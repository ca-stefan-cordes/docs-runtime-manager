The Anypoint VPN feature enables you to create a secure connection to systems within your network that are hosted outside of Anypoint Platform. 

[NOTE]
If required, you can create multiple Anypoint VPNs to connect to different networks or different regions within a network. The number of Anypoint VPNs you can create depends on the Anypoint VPN capacity allocated to your account. Contact your MuleSoft account representative to discuss your requirements.

To create and maintain a secure connection with your external network, the Anypoint VPN provides the following features:

* Route-based access via 2-byte and 4-byte autonomous system numbers (ASN). This defines the routing policies used to connect to your network through the Anypoint VPN.
* Reusable IP addresses.
* Tunnel configuration.

[NOTE]
Network Address Translation (NAT) is not supported.

== Supported IPsec Configurations

Anypoint VPN supports the IPsec configurations for encrypting data communications between Anypoint Platform and your network:

* IKE version 1 and 2
* AES 128 and 256-bit encryption
* SHA and SHA-2 hashing
* Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups:
** Phase1 DH groups 2, 14-18, 22, 23, 24
** Phase2 DH groups 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, 24

[NOTE]
Because the Anypoint VPN endpoint is the responder, be sure to establish and maintain connections by initiating traffic from a remote device.

== Anypoint VPN Routing

The Anypoint VPN supports two types of routing:

* Border Gateway Protocol (*BGP*) routing - Your device uses BGP to dynamically advertise its routes to Anypoint VPN. BGP routing is recommended if your device supports this protocol.
* *Static* - Requires you to specify the routes (subnets) for your network that should be accessible to Anypoint VPN.
